Fair warning this shit is ass. Proceed at own risk!
The build instructions are generated by copilot so if they don't work then I dunno make it work and make a PR.

## New features and suggestions

This project is under active development and features requests are welcome.

## Build & Run Instructions

1. **Install dependencies**
   
   Open a terminal in the project directory and run:
   
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server**
   
   ```sh
   npx vite
   ```
   This will start the Vite dev server. Open the URL shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

3. **Build for production**
   
   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```
   The production build will be output to the `dist/` directory.

4. **Preview the production build**
   
   ```sh
   npx vite preview
   ```
   This will serve the built files locally for testing.
